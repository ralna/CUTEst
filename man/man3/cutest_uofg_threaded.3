.SH NAME
CUTEST_uofg_threaded \- CUTEst tool to evaluate function value and possibly gradient.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP 1i
CALL CUTEST_uofg_threaded( status, n, X, f, G, grad, thread )

.HP 1i
For real rather than double precision arguments, instead

.HP 1i
CALL CUTEST_uofg_threaded_s( ... )

.HP 1i
and for quadruple precision arguments, when available,

.HP 1i
CALL CUTEST_uofg_threaded_q( ... )

.SH DESCRIPTION
The CUTEST_uofg_threaded subroutine evaluates the value of the objective 
function of the problem decoded from a SIF file by the script \fIsifdecoder\fP
at the point X, and possibly its gradient.

The problem under consideration
is to minimize or maximize an objective function
.EQ
f(x)
.EN
over all
.EQ
x
.EN
\(mo
.EQ
R sup n
.EN
subject to the simple bounds
.EQ
x sup l ~<=~ x ~<=~ x sup u.
.EN
The objective function is group-partially separable.

.SH ARGUMENTS
The arguments of CUTEST_uofg_threaded are as follows
.TP 5
.B status \fP[out] - integer
the outputr status: 0 for a succesful call, 1 for an array 
allocation/deallocation error, 2 for an array bound error,
3 for an evaluation error, 4 for an out-of-range thread,
.TP
.B n \fP[in] - integer
the number of variables for the problem,
.TP
.B X \fP[in] - real/double precision
an array which gives the current estimate of the solution of the
problem,
.TP
.B f \fP[out] - real/double precision
the value of the objective function evaluated at X,
.TP
.B G \fP[out] - real/double precision
an array which gives the value of the gradient of the objective
function evaluated at X,
.TP
.B grad \fP[in] - logical
a logical variable which should be set to .TRUE. if the gradient of
the objective function is required and .FALSE. otherwise.
.LP 
.SH NOTE
A call to CUTEST_uofg_threaded is more efficient than two separate 
calls to CUTEST_ufn_threaded and CUTEST_ugr_threaded,
.TP
.B thread \fP[inout] - integer
thread chosen for the evaluation; threads are numbered
from 1 to the value threads set when calling CUTEST_usetup_threaded.
