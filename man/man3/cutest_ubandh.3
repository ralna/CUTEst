.SH NAME
CUTEST_ubandh \- CUTEst tool to extract a banded matrix out of the Hessian
matrix.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP 1i
CALL CUTEST_ubandh( status, n, X, nsemib, BANDH, lbandh, maxsbw )

.HP 1i
For real rather than double precision arguments, instead

.HP 1i
CALL CUTEST_ubandh_s( ... )

.HP 1i
and for quadruple precision arguments, when available,

.HP 1i
CALL CUTEST_ubandh_q( ... )

.SH DESCRIPTION
The CUTEST_ubandh subroutine extracts the elements which lie within a band
of given semi-bandwidth out of the Hessian matrix of the objective
function of the problem decoded from a SIF file by the script
\fIsifdecoder\fP at the point X.

The problem under consideration
is to minimize or maximize an objective function

The objective function is group-partially separable.

.SH ARGUMENTS
The arguments of CUTEST_ubandh are as follows
.TP 5
.B status \fP[out] - integer
the outputr status: 0 for a succesful call, 1 for an array 
allocation/deallocation error, 2 for an array bound error,
3 for an evaluation error,
.TP
.B n \fP[in] - integer
the number of variables for the problem,
.TP
.B X \fP[in] - real/double precision
the derivatives will be evaluated at X. 
.TP
.B nsemib \fP[in] - integer
the required semi-bandwidth, i.e., the required number of bands directly below
the diagonal of the band Hessian approximation.
.TP
.B BANDH \fP[out] - real/double precision
a two-dimensional array of dimension (0:lbandh,n) which gives the
lower triangular part of the band segment of the Hessian. The diagonal
entry in column i is returned in location BANDH(0,i), while the entry
j places below the diagonal in column i may be found in location
BANDH(j,i),
.TP
.B lbandh \fP[in] - integer
the actual declared size of the leading dimension of BANDH (with
lbandh no smaller than nsemib). N.B. the leading component of BANDH
includes the index 0 so strictly, the size of the leading dimension is
lbandh + 1.
.TP
.B maxsbw \fP[out] - integer
the actual semi-bandwidth, i.e., the actual number of bands directly below
the diagonal of the Hessian.
