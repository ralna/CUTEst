.SH NAME
CUTEST_chprod_threaded \- CUTEst tool to form the matrix-vector product of a 
vector with the Hessian matrix of the Lagrangian.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP 1i
CALL CUTEST_chprod_threaded( status, n, m, goth, X, Y, VECTOR, RESULT, thread )

.HP 1i
For real rather than double precision arguments, instead

.HP 1i
CALL CUTEST_chprod_threaded_s( ... )

.HP 1i
and for quadruple precision arguments, when available,

.HP 1i
CALL CUTEST_chprod_threaded_q( ... )

.SH DESCRIPTION
The CUTEST_chprod_threaded subroutine forms the product of a vector with 
the Hessian matrix of the Lagrangian function 
.EQ
l(x,y) = f(x) + y sup T c(x)
.EN
corresponding to the problem decoded from a SIF file by the script
\fIsifdecoder\fP at the point
.EQ
(x,y) = 
.EN
(X,Y).

The problem under consideration
is to minimize or maximize an objective function

The objective function is group-partially separable 
and all constraint functions are partially separable.

.SH ARGUMENTS
The arguments of CUTEST_chprod_threaded are as follows
.TP 5
.B status \fP[out] - integer
the outputr status: 0 for a succesful call, 1 for an array 
allocation/deallocation error, 2 for an array bound error,
3 for an evaluation error, 4 for an out-of-range thread,
.TP
.B n \fP[in] - integer
the number of variables for the problem,
.TP
.B m \fP[in] - integer
the total number of general constraints,
.TP
.B goth \fP[in] - logical
a logical variable which specifies whether the first and second derivatives of
the groups and elements have already been set (goth = .TRUE.) or if
they should be computed (goth = .FALSE.),
.TP
.B X \fP[in] - real/double precision
when goth = .FALSE., the derivatives will be evaluated at X. Otherwise
X is not used.
.TP
.B Y \fP[in] - real/double precision
when goth = .FALSE., the derivatives will be evaluated with Lagrange
multipliers Y. Otherwise Y is not used,
.TP
.B VECTOR \fP[in] - real/double precision
an array which gives the vector whose product with the Hessian is
required,
.TP
.B RESULT \fP[out] - real/double precision
an array which gives the result of multiplying the Hessian by VECTOR. 
.LP
.SH NOTE
goth should be set to .TRUE. whenever
.TP 3
.B (1)\fP
a call has been made to CUTEST_cdh_threaded, CUTEST_csh_threaded, 
CUTEST_cgrdh_threaded or CUTEST_csgrsh_threaded 
at the current point, or
.TP
.B (2)\fP
a previous call to CUTEST_chprod_threaded, with goth = .FALSE., at 
the current point 
has been made.
.TP
.B \fPOtherwise, it should be set .FALSE.,
.TP
.B thread \fP[out] - integer
thread chosen for the evaluation; threads are numbered
from 1 to the value threads set when calling CUTEST_csetup_threaded.
