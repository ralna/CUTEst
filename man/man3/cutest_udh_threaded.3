.SH NAME
CUTEST_udh_threaded \- CUTEst tool to evaluate the Hessian matrix.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP 1i
CALL CUTEST_udh_threaded( status, n, X, lh1, H_val, thread )

.HP 1i
For real rather than double precision arguments, instead

.HP 1i
CALL CUTEST_udh_threaded_s( ... )

.HP 1i
and for quadruple precision arguments, when available,

.HP 1i
CALL CUTEST_udh_threaded_q( ... )

.SH DESCRIPTION
The CUTEST_udh_threaded subroutine evaluates the Hessian matrix of the objective
function of the problem decoded from a SIF file by the script
\fIsifdecoder\fP at the point X. This Hessian matrix is stored as
a dense matrix.

The problem under consideration
is to minimize or maximize an objective function
.EQ
f(x)
.EN
over all
.EQ
x
.EN
\(mo
.EQ
R sup n
.EN
subject to the simple bounds
.EQ
x sup l ~<=~ x ~<=~ x sup u.
.EN
The objective function is group-partially separable.

.SH ARGUMENTS
The arguments of CUTEST_udh_threaded are as follows
.TP 5
.B status \fP[out] - integer
the outputr status: 0 for a succesful call, 1 for an array 
allocation/deallocation error, 2 for an array bound error,
3 for an evaluation error, 4 for an out-of-range thread,
.TP
.B n \fP[in] - integer
the number of variables for the problem,
.TP
.B X \fP[in] - real/double precision
an array which gives the current estimate of the solution of the
problem,
.TP
.B lh1 \fP[in] - integer
the actual declared size of the leading dimension of H_val (with lh1 no
smaller than N),
.TP
.B H_val \fP[out] - real/double precision
a two-dimensional array which gives the value of the Hessian matrix of
the objective function evaluated at X,
.TP
.B thread \fP[in] - integer
thread chosen for the evaluation; threads are numbered
from 1 to the value threads set when calling CUTEST_usetup_threaded.
